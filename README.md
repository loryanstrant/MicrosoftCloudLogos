# Microsoft Logos

This collection of logos has been built over the years using both official Microsoft logo packages, as well as hard to find places (i.e. scraping websites or blog posts, product catalogues, and anywhere I can find them).
I try to keep this current, and also retain legacy logos just for the sake of it.

(While I've called the repo "Microsoft Logos", in reality it's mainly corporate/enterprise cloud services.)

Enjoy!
